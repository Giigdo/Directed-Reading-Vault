There is a significant body of work in HCI concerning the design of digital teaching tools and online digital resources to support students learning STEM subjects.Â  However, despite the amount of prior work in this area, there has been little investigate and/or intentional human-centered technology design/creation to address STEM educational support through a lens of building up Indigenous knowledge connected to STEM subjects. This project is an attempt to critically examine existing scholarship related to HCI approaches in STEM education, with a specific focus on the intersection of: 

(i) approaches that include (or are derived from) Indigenous work and 
(ii) approaches that examine where the design of technological systems is intended to support the continuance of knowledge and community. 

The readings have been selected to examine the intersection of STEM pedagogical technologies and Indigenous Knowledge and to investigate how these points of congruence identify opportunities for community advancement and the transmission of Indigenous knowledge via computational products supportive of Indigenous community resurgence as opposed to community assimilation and corporate expansion into Indigenous communities.

The [[0. Critical Analyses]] and the [[Lesson Plans and Connection to Other Work]] in this web resource demonstrate an alternative approach to academic writing, much like that of online journals that have been created for Digital media research. However, my broader goal is to develop an Indigenous methodology, created by and for Indigenous people, that enables communities to establish living archives or 'digital bundles of knowledge' (as termed by Jennifer Wemigwans,  *[Toward a Media Theory of the Digital Bundle](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781478022497-015/html)*) and pose a different type of peer review - one that is situated in community not those who control publishing. These archives will be grounded in each community's unique context and ways of being, empowering them to share information with their members, both on and off reserve, and with teachers and school boards. This will hopefully further support the Indian Brotherhood's 1972 declaration calling for Indian control of Indian education. I hope my larger dissertation project sparks a process where students learn with online resources created by their own community, and teachers receive professional development tailored to that community's specific needs and knowledge, building a more inclusive and community-driven education system.
