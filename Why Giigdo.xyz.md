Why giigdo.xyz? Well, this is going to be an experiment in decolonization so I feel I have to do my best to move away from the idea that English is the language of the internet. I have gone with the word “giigdo” which means “he or she speaks.” Conveniently it is already in the third person, and transcends gender lines of male or female because Ojibwe grammar does not delineate gender in conjugation. 

The word just refers to "that person over there speaking", which is a move away from colonial languages. Still, I do have to use the conventions of the internet as they exist, so I had to come up with something after the dot. In this case, I went with XYZ because it’s not tied to a community or organization. It doesn’t sit under .com, which reminds me of company, and it doesn’t sit under .ca, which stands for Canada, a colonial nation, which is coincidentally the place I’m writing from.

There is not a .indigenous or, better yet, a .ojibwe, domain yet - though maybe we should have them- so in the meantime, I’ll work with giigdo.xyz as the name for this site because, really, it is just experiment, along with many others, in decolonizing the internet.
