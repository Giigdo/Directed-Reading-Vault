As a Nishinaabe person, I'm mindful of cultural appropriation concerns which is why I am following protocols for working with Indigenous knowledge. My project focuses on storytelling and story methods already developed by Indigenous scholars like [Archibald](https://indigenousstorywork.com/), and builds upon Indigenous education practices established by researchers like [Hupfield]([http://hdl.handle.net/10315/34206](http://hdl.handle.net/10315/34206)). To be safe though I am not capturing or using sacred knowledge in my work here or my larger dissertation. Instead I am creating a methodology for Indigenous communities to self-represent and share their stories, knowledge, and experiences through digital media as they choose. Data sovereignty is a serious concern in developing this work and it will be a key component of the dissertation attached to this archive in time. I aim to empower communities to take control of their own narrative, present themselves as they see fit, and effectively direct the education of their children in the schools and boards of education they are connected to. This project prioritizes Indigenous autonomy, self-determination, and self-representation.
