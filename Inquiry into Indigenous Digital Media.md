In my larger work I am investigating digital media products created by Indigenous people, whether for artistic or educational purposes. I want to assess their effectiveness in teaching Indigenous students subject matter valued in Western school systems while fostering a sense of cultural understanding and identity. I want to explore whether digital media tools are showing promise in helping Indigenous students grasp and appreciate both their own culture and Western concepts in science, mathematics, and technology, as presented in dominant school systems. I want to do this in order to make use of the large resources of state education to ensure that Indigenous students understand the larger society that surrounds them while also ensuring they maintain their own separate knowledge and value systems.
